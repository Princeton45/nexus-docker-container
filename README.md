# My Journey Deploying Nexus as a Docker Container on DigitalOcean

Hey everyone! This README is a summary of my experience deploying Nexus Repository Manager as a Docker container on a DigitalOcean Droplet. I'll outline the key steps I took to get everything up and running, and I've also included some suggestions for visuals you could use to make it even more illustrative.

## Project Goal

My aim was to have a functional Nexus Repository Manager running in a Docker container, hosted on a DigitalOcean Droplet. This provides a reliable and easily manageable way to store and manage artifacts.

## Technologies I Used

*   **Docker:** To containerize the Nexus application, making it portable and easy to deploy.
*   **Nexus Repository Manager:** The artifact repository I wanted to deploy.
*   **DigitalOcean:** The cloud provider I used to host the server (Droplet).
*   **Linux:** The operating system running on my Droplet (specifically, Ubuntu).

## Steps I Took to Deploy Nexus

Here's how I set up Nexus on DigitalOcean:

### 1. Created a DigitalOcean Droplet

First, I needed a server to work with. I created a new Droplet on DigitalOcean, which is essentially a virtual server. I chose Ubuntu as the operating system and selected a Droplet size suitable for running Nexus.

*   **Suggestions for Visuals:**
    *   **Picture 1:** A screenshot of the DigitalOcean dashboard showing my newly created Droplet, highlighting its IP address and specifications.

### 2. Set Up Docker on the Droplet

With the Droplet ready, I installed Docker on it. This allowed me to run containerized applications, including Nexus.

*   **Suggestions for Visuals:**
    *   **Picture 2:** My terminal showing the output of `docker --version`, confirming that Docker was successfully installed on the Droplet.

### 3. Ran Nexus as a Docker Container

Finally, I used Docker to pull the official Nexus image from Docker Hub and started it as a container. I also made sure to map the necessary ports and volumes so that Nexus could function correctly and its data would persist.

*   **Suggestions for Visuals:**
    *   **Picture 3:** My terminal showing the `docker run` command I used to start the Nexus container, highlighting the port and volume mappings.
    *   **Picture 4:** A screenshot of the `docker ps` output, showing the running Nexus container.

### 4. Accessed the Nexus UI

After starting the container, I accessed the Nexus web interface through my browser using the Droplet's IP address and the port I mapped during the container setup. I retrieved the initial admin password and logged in, completing the initial Nexus setup.

*   **Suggestions for Visuals:**
    *   **Picture 5:** My browser displaying the Nexus login page.
    *   **Picture 6:** The Nexus UI after successfully logging in, showing the various repositories and configuration options.

## Conclusion

That's it! I now have Nexus Repository Manager successfully deployed and accessible, thanks to Docker and DigitalOcean. This setup is ideal for managing artifacts in my development workflow. I hope sharing my experience helps you in your own deployments. Happy coding!
